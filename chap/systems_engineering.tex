\subsection{Power Budget of the Readout Electronics}
\label{sec:power_budget}
This power budget (see tab. \ref{tab:power_budget}) is based on the power consumption in the data sheets of the electronic components used in the design.
The power consumption of the FPGA is a large estimate, since it depends on the implemented logic.
Also the DRS's power consumption is an estimate based on the value given in a book\footnote{Typical specifications for pixel chips used in particle physics: Power dissipation per pixel \textless $50\mu m$.\cite{rossi2006pixel}}, the real value will depend on the final design.

The budget seems to be realistic, since the total consumed power is close to the 0.9W\cite[p. 11, tab. 4]{tantalumproject2016} of the RADEM mission, which uses a similar DRS.
