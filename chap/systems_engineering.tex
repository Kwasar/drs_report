\section{Systems Engineering Considerations}
\label{sec:systems_engineering}

\subsection{Power Budget of the Readout Electronics}
\label{sec:power_budget}
This power budget (see tab. \ref{tab:power_budget}) is based on the power consumption in the data sheets of the electronic components used in the design.
The power consumption of the FPGA is a large estimate, since it depends on the implemented logic.
Also the DRS's power consumption is an estimate based on the value given in a book\footnote{Typical specifications for pixel chips used in particle physics: Power dissipation per pixel \textless $50\mu m$.\cite{rossi2006pixel}}, the real value will depend on the final design.

\end{table}

The budget seems to be realistic, since the total consumed power is close to the 0.9W\cite[p. 11, tab. 4]{tantalumproject2016} of the RADEM mission, which uses a similar DRS.

\subsection{Data Rate and digital resources}
Based on the timing behavior of the FPGA hardware (see fig. \ref{fig:Simulation}) as well as the operating clock frequencies of the interfaces, the maximum data rate generated by the directional radiation sensor through the readout electronics can be estimated.

\end{table}

Another important consideration are the available hardware gate resources on the FPGA. In the Libero SoC software, the require digital resources can be estimated.


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$I^2C$}{TEXT} Interfaces}
\label{sec:i2c_interfaces}
Some electric components in the design can only be accessed via an $I^2C$ interface. 
Their addresses are defined in the following table:

\end{table}
