\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The project accomplished a first electronic and logic design to readout the DRS from PSI for the Tantalum cubesat mission.
The vast information gathered should help a future student to quickly catch on to the task and thereby help her or him to improve and extent the existing work.
The next important step in development is the exact systems engineering level decision on a data bus architecture inside the cubesat.
A PCB would need to be produced to test the DRS's readout electronics, during this process more profound trade-offs would need to be done considering the footprint of the components.
%TODO For the logic part blabla, do more shit, blablabla

We learned a lot of interesting and new concepts during this project.
It also let us experience the difficulties in the design of a payload instrument.
Numerous parameters have to be traded off and the many interdependencies with other subsystems and organizations made this task a fascinating challenge.

The Tantalum mission aims to study a still unknown world just outside of the Earth's atmosphere.
It's potential outcome would have a huge impact on commercial, as well as scientific satellites and would enable a wider use of new propulsion technology, like electric propulsion.
We hope that this contribution will bring the project a step closer to realization and launch.

%Data rates and digital resources need to be re-evaluated every time the design is updated and expanded.
