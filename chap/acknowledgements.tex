\section*{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:acknowledgements}
First of all we would like to thank Reinhold Kramert for his many inputs and his help.
Without him the realization of this project would not have been possible.

Our gratitude also goes to Muriel Richard and Wojtek Hajdas for their support and discussions.

Finally we would like to thank the rest of the Proton Irradiation Facility at PSI for giving us helpful information and input.
